float32 range                            # Distance (m) from the sensor to the detected return.
float32 azimuth                          # Angle (in radians) in the azimuth plane between the sensor and the detected return.
                                         #    Positive angles are anticlockwise from the sensor and negative angles clockwise from the sensor as per REP-0103.
float32 elevation                        # Angle (in radians) in the elevation plane between the sensor and the detected return.
                                         #    Negative angles are below the sensor. For 2D radar, this will be 0.
float32 doppler_velocity                 # The doppler speeds (m/s) of the return.
float32 amplitude                        # The amplitude of the of the return (dB)
